## What are the goals of a PR?

Goals in order of importance:

1. Ensure correctness
2. Spread and share knowledge
3. Improve the design
4. Ensure consistency

## Guide for authors

### Who do I assign as a reviewer?

* Default to a single reviewer
* Reviewer should be selected based on:
  * Knowledge of reviewer (for example, if changing code related to events, @johngallagher has done work in this area)
  * Skills of reviewer (for example, @karlentwistle is skilled with performance testing)
* If other developers have more knowledge than the reviewer, the reviewer can pull them into the conversation
* For PRs in patterns, always assign the whole of Engineering

### Timescales

* The reviewer should give you a timescale when you can expect your PR to be reviewed.
* This means you can plan your day
* Look for a comment in the PR

### Scope creep

If you get feedback that's outside the scope of the ticket:
1. Create another ticket
2. Link to the ticket in a comment then resolve the comment


### What should be included in a PR?

PRs should be small and focussed.

Make sure you include everything on the [PR Checklist](#pr-checklist)

## Guide for reviewers

### What's the mindset?

1. To check the author's work for correctness
2. To prompt for better ways at approaching the problem
3. To look at the problem through fresh eyes
4. To encourage good design and progress of the codebase
5. To ask for the PR to be small enough so they can productively review it

### Timescale

* When asked to review a PR, please let the author know when you'll be able to review it
* Leave a comment on the PR tagging the author with the expectation, for example:

> @authorname I'll review this at 10am GMT Friday 13th March

### Scope creep

* If you give feedback that's outside the scope, bear in mind it won't necessarily be addressed within this PR
* The author should create a ticket for this follow up work, post a link and resolve the comment

### What should be included in a PR?

PRs should be small and focussed.

It's your right to ask for the PR to be broken down.

## Example of a great PR

## [BIG-123] Add authentication support for dashboard

## What

I've added support for authentication to implement the dashboard. It includes model, table, controller and test.

## Why

These changes complete the user login and account creation experience. See #JIRA-123 for more information.

## How

This includes a migration, model and controller for user authentication. I'm using Devise to do the heavy lifting. I ran Devise migrations and those are included here.

## Testing

### ðŸŸ¢ When user logs in they are shown the dashboard

âœ… User is shown dashboard
âœ… Logs indicate success

### ðŸŸ¢ When a guest user visits the dashboard they are redirected to the home page

âœ… User is shown home page
âœ… Warning shown in logs

## Anything Else?

Let's consider using a 3rd party authentication provider for this, to offload MFA and other considerations as they arise and as the privacy landscape evolves.

AWS Cognito is a good option, so is Firebase. I'm happy to start researching this path.

Let's also consider breaking this out into its own service. We can then re-use it or share the accounts with other apps in the future.
