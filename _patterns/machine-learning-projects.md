Getting started with Machine Learning projects can be very difficult, especially if you're unfamiliar with the rampant jargon. There are many books, blog posts, videos and podcasts on the subject, but it can be hard for an experienced Ruby engineer to know where to begin -- non-specific materials often expect either too little programming experience or a PhD in Mathematics, Computer Science or Statistics. This document is intended to help you, and experienced Rub software engineer, get up to speed quickly building a project that uses Machine Learning effectively.
