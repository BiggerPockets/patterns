Occasionally, an engineer will need to make an emergency change to production code that cannot wait for the normal pull request approval process. In these cases, it is the engineer's discretion to perform a commit rather than waiting for another engineer to approve their pull request. As soon as reasonable, the engineer should seek a post-commit review from another engineer.
