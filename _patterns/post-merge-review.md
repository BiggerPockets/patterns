Occasionally, an engineer will need to make an emergency change to production code that cannot wait for the normal review process. In these cases, it is the engineer's discretion to perform a commit rather than waiting for another engineer to approve their pull request. As soon as reasonable, the engineer should seek a post-commit review from another engineer.
