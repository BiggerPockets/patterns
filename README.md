# Patterns

This is a collection of guidelines and style guide rules that we follow when writing software at BiggerPockets. Use these to guide implementation and reference them during peer review.

- [Ruby]({{ "/ruby" | relative_url }})
- [Rails]({{ "/rails" | relative_url }})
- [RSpec]({{ "/rspec" | relative_url }})
- [Javascript]({{ "/javascript" | relative_url }})
- [CSS]({{ "/css" | relative_url }})

## Contributing

To propose a new rule, or a change to an existing rule, open a Pull Request that includes the changes in a markdown-formatted file. Try to follow the same format as existing rule files.

To test the Jekyll site locally run:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
